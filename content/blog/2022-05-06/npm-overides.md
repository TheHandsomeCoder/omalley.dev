# Fixing a broken library with npm overrides

Hey! recently I've been putting together a small program to track the temprature inside of a handme down fridge. I'd planned to use my [Nordic Thingy52](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/Nordic-Thingy-52) as it has all the sensors I need plus it's own power source, but unfortunately I found that it's NodeJS reference implementation was built with an [abandoned Bluetooth Low Energy library](https://github.com/noble/noble) which had stopped working with OSX after High Sierra. 

Thankfully a few fine folks came together to create [@abandonware ](https://abandonware.github.io/) and have forked and updated noble. 



But that still leaves the problem of how to update a library that depends on it.

## What are our options






## Goals
* Serves Chult above all else, though he may take employment, it is only to futher the goal of protecting Chult from the agents of Dendar.
* Crush the agents of Dendar,
* Undertakes all steps to empower Ubtao in keeping with his ancient rights.

## Rumours
The Spearbearers of Ubtao made it their duty to protect the world from Dendar. Their goal was to give Ubtao the necessary strength to defeat the Night Serpent when she finally came to eat the sun. Towards that end, they conducted a large number of rituals, many of which involved sentient sacrifices. Maybe he's not a good dude and is continuing to follow these rituals to encourage the return of Ubtao.

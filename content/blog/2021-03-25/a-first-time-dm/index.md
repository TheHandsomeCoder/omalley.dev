I recently ran my first Dungeons and Dragons game from *behind the board*. I spent the better part of a month setting up scenes in Roll20, reading the one-shot end to end and watching several people on youtube running the game to know what to expect. As far as I can tell a good time was had by all and I actually can't wait to do it again even with the huge amount of time it required. 

### The prep

The one-shot I ran is called the [Wolves of Welton](https://winghornpress.com/adventures/wolves-of-welton/). It's a free module from Winghorn press for DnD 5e. In addition I read nearly all the [Encounter of the Week](https://www.dndbeyond.com/tag/encounter-of-the-week) posts on dndbeyond.com to get ideas of how things could be fit in should my players go off the rails.  

As we were playing online over discord I elected to use Roll20 to give my players a virtual tabletop to better see encounters and interact with NPCs. For the maps I mainly got assets off Reddit and Pinterest linked to the Wolves of Welton 

For character sheets I used dndbeyond.com in conjunction with the [Beyond20](https://beyond20.here-for-more.info/) browser extension to allow my players to roll from their character sheets into Roll20 directly which saved a lot of setup hassle.

### The game
The game was pretty standard, I'd originally budgeted 3-4 hours to complete the one-shot, But in total it took closer to 5. Additionally I had planned for 4-5 players in the game, but ended up with only 2 on the day. This was mostly due to me not setting a date and time for the game when I asked people to play and having to deal with a 9 hour difference in time zones for some players.

### Some other thoughts
While reading the different encounters I noticed there's a recurring theme to reference the equipment list in order to generate the inventory for stores in game. It was the only thing I didn't find a tool for specifically which I found weird. There really should be an app for that.

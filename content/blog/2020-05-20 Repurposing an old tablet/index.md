COVID19 has forced my Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) group entirely online.

Our current game setup consists of a Discord server for video/voice and Fantasy Grounds, a virtual tabletop that allows for playing D&D remotely. Those of us who want more control run our own local copy of Fantasy Grounds, for those who don't the DM uses Discords streaming feature to stream a copy of fantasy grounds.

One of our members currently only has access to a phone, and while serviceable it's not ideal for with our current stream setup.

Our DM has a fantasy grounds ultimate sub and pain stakingly moved our characters over from DnDBeyond so we can play online.
